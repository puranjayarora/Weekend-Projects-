Following Miura, Islero, Countach, and Urraco, Lamborghini’s most iconic model now reaps the inheritance of the historic S models and evolves into the new Aventador S Coupé. Exclusive Lamborghini design and the new V12 engine with a whopping 740 HP now join the most sophisticated technology of the range, featuring the new LDVA (Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Attiva/Lamborghini Active Vehicle Dynamics), which offers an unparalleled driving experience to all those who honour their egos by challenging themselves every day.</font></b></td>

It is the sign of recognition of a thoroughbred power, with its excellent acceleration performance at any engine speed, lightning-fast responsiveness, a breathtaking roar, and now a full 40 HP more to unleash on the asphalt. But Aventador S Coupé will not settle for less and wants everything: the performance features of a super sports car are joined by the extreme agility and handling of the 4 Wheel Steering system for unprecedented driving dynamics, along with the possibility to have the most personal driving experience ever thanks to the brand new EGO customised driving mode.</font></b></td>

Aventador S Coupé continues to display the unmistakable Lamborghini DNA, while strengthening its mix of dynamism, refinement, and aggressiveness by means of even sharper lines inspired by nature and by aeronautics. While the hexagonal design of the new tailpipes means that the rear end is as powerful as the engine of a space shuttle, the front end features forms that recall the fins of a shark, transmitting the same force and elegance in dominating the road. But the design of a Lamborghini is never an end in itself..</font></b></td>

The options also include the possibility to choose an innovative material such as Carbon Skin® and to have certain parts of the carbon body left exposed. The elegance of the interior is matched with the extremely advanced technology, such as the instrument panel with interactive TFT LCD display with completely redesigned graphics, and the possibility to enhance the interiors with a LED lighting system created ad hoc.</font></b></td>

The lateral vehicle dynamics is controlled by a steering system that involves all four wheels using Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) and Lamborghini Rear-wheel Steering (LRS). The vertical vehicle dynamics is handled by the Lamborghini Magneto-rheological suspension (LMS) and the active rear aerodynamics. And the longitudinal dynamics relies on the four-wheel drive system (4WD). The LDVA system combines all the information coming from the car’s sensors and establishes in real time the best setting for each driving condition. The result is performance that is absolutely perfect, safe, and compelling.Choosing the car of your dreams means making one with your own hands. This is why Lamborghini has always been synonymous with personalisation. Exterior and interior colours, stitching, materials for the passenger compartment, and brake calipers: the combinations are potentially infinite and allow you to have a car that is truly unique: yours. Our dealers will be available to advise you in detail on the many possible personalisations, so that your automobile is truly in line with your needs and, above all, with your personality.</font></b></td>
