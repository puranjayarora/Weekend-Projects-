# WEEKEND PROJECTS 
Weekend Projects contains a collection of 2 easy websites made just for getting a hang of the basic web development languages. One of them is a webpage about product details. The product is Lamborghini Aventador S Coupe. Most of the images on the webpage have been designed and edited using Adobe Photoshop. The second project is designed to be the homepage of the Indian Railways. This webpage has a better GUI than that of the offical IRCTC website on that day. It is more user friendly and looks modern with all the custom made icons and images designed with Adobe Photoshop.
